# MnDOT_PV_Project

This repository contains documents associated with the MnDOT Project as of 2/13/2020.

I would like to use this as a place to host documents for collaboration into the future, as well as compile a place to show employers work samples. You will be able to find documents like PCB layouts, circuit schematics, and code for the controller. There are also a lot of isolated parts libraries scattered around the place, and I would like to consolidate these into one large library.

To access it, you'll need the following software:

Code Composer Studio (CCS) from Texas Instruments
Altium Designer

A thorough documentation of changes to code prior to 2/13/2020 can be found in the file "Software Notes as of 2/13/2020."
